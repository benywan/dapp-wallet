# LEGAL WARNING LONG VERSION

The following Terms and Conditions (&quot;Terms&quot;) govern the use of Parity Technologies Limited&#39;s open source software product (&quot;Parity&quot;). Prior to any use of Parity or any of Parity Technologies Limited&#39;s products (&quot;Parity Technologies&#39; Products&quot;), you (&quot;User&quot; or &quot;you&quot;) confirm on your own behalf and on behalf of anyone who uses Parity on your behalf that you (and they) understand, expressly agree to and will comply with all of the Terms. All capitalized words and expressions in these Terms will have the effect and meaning given to them in the Terms. The group of developers and other personnel that is now, or will be, employed by, or contracted with, or affiliated with, Parity Technologies Limited (&quot;Parity Technologies&quot; or &quot;we&quot;) is termed the &quot;Parity Technologies Team&quot;.

## Acknowledgement of Risks

The User acknowledges the following serious risks to any use of Parity and expressly agrees not to hold liable Parity Technologies or the Parity Technologies Team should any of these risks occur:

## Risk of Security Weaknesses in the Parity Core Infrastructure Software

Parity uses open-source libraries and components developed by third parties. While Parity Technologies Limited generally aims to use only widely adopted open-source technology and develop it in line with industry standards, such open-source technology may contain bugs and errors and may not function correctly in all circumstances. As a result, there is a risk that Parity Technologies or the Parity Technologies Team may have introduced unintentional weaknesses or bugs into the core infrastructural elements of Parity causing the system to lose Ethereum tokens (&quot;ETH&quot;) stored in one or more User accounts or other accounts or lose sums of other valued tokens.

## Risk of Weaknesses or Exploitable Breakthroughs in the Field of Cryptography

Cryptography is an art, not a science, and the state of the art can advance over time. Advances in code cracking, or technical advances such as the development of quantum computers, could present risks to cryptocurrencies and Parity, which could result in the theft or loss of ETH. To the extent possible, Parity Technologies intends to update the protocol underlying Parity to account for any advances in cryptography and to incorporate additional security measures, but it cannot predict the future of cryptography or guarantee that any security updates will be made, timely or successful.

## Risk of Ether Mining Attacks

As with other cryptocurrencies, the blockchain accessed by Parity is susceptible to mining attacks, including but not limited to double-spend attacks, majority mining power attacks, &quot;selfish-mining&quot; attacks, and race condition attacks. Any successful attacks present a risk to the Ethereum ecosystem, expected proper execution and sequencing of ETH transactions, and expected proper execution and sequencing of contract computations. Despite the efforts of Parity Technologies and the Parity Technologies Team, known or novel mining attacks may be successful.

## Risk of Rapid Adoption and Insufficiency of Computational Application Processing Power on the

## Ethereum Network

If Ethereum is rapidly adopted, the demand for transaction processing and distributed application computations could rise dramatically and at a pace that exceeds the rate with which ETH miners can bring online additional mining power. Under such a scenario, the entire Ethereum ecosystem could become destabilized, due to the increased cost of running distributed applications. In turn, this could dampen interest in the Ethereum ecosystem and ETH. Insufficiency of computational resources and an associated rise in the price of ETH could result in businesses being unable to acquire scarce computational resources to run their distributed applications. This would represent revenue losses to businesses or worst case, cause businesses to cease operations because such operations have become uneconomical due to distortions in the crypto-economy.

## Risk of temporary network incoherence

We recommend any groups handling large or important transactions to maintain a voluntary 24 hour waiting period on any ETH deposited. If we become aware that the integrity of the network is at risk due to issues with Parity, we will endeavour to publish patches in a timely fashion to address the issues. We will endeavour to provide solutions within the voluntary 24 hour waiting period.

## General legal terms

Sometimes when you use Parity or Parity Technologies&#39; Products, you may (as a result of, or in connection with your use of these products) use a service or download a piece of software, or smart contract, or purchase goods, which are provided by another person or company. Your use of these other services, software, smart contract or goods may be subject to separate terms between you and the company or person concerned. If so, these Terms do not affect your legal relationship with these other companies or individuals.

These Terms (including the Software Licence Terms) constitute the whole legal agreement between you and Parity Technologies and govern your use of Parity and Parity Technologies&#39; Products (but excluding any products or services which Parity Technologies may provide to you under a separate written agreement), and completely replace any prior agreements between you and Parity Technologies in relation to Parity and Parity Technologies&#39; Products.

You agree that Parity Technologies may provide you with notices, including those regarding changes to the Terms, by postings on Parity or the affected Parity Technologies&#39; Product.

You agree that if Parity Technologies does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which is contained in these Terms (or which Parity Technologies has the benefit of under any applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Parity Technologies&#39; rights and that those rights or remedies will still be available to Parity Technologies.

If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules that any provision of these Terms is invalid, then that provision will be removed from the Terms without affecting the rest of the Terms. The remaining provisions of the Terms will continue to be valid and enforceable.

You acknowledge and agree that each member of the group of companies of which Parity Technologies is the parent shall be third party beneficiaries to these Terms and that such other companies shall be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any provision of the Terms which confers a benefit on (or rights in favour of) them. Other than this, no other person or company shall be third party beneficiaries to these Terms.

These Terms, and your relationship with Parity Technologies under these Terms, shall be governed by the laws of England and Wales, United Kingdom. You and Parity Technologies agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within England, United Kingdom to resolve any legal matter arising from these Terms (subject to the Dispute Resolution clause below). Notwithstanding this, you agree that Parity Technologies shall still be allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in any jurisdiction.

## Dispute Resolution

All disputes or claims arising out of, relating to, or in connection with the Terms, the breach thereof, or use of Parity shall be finally settled under the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce by one or more arbitrators appointed in accordance with said Rules. All claims between the parties relating to these Terms that are capable of being resolved by arbitration, whether sounding in contract, tort, or otherwise, shall be submitted to ICC arbitration. Prior to commencing arbitration, the parties have a duty to negotiate in good faith and attempt to resolve their dispute in a manner other than by submission to ICC arbitration. The arbitration panel shall consist of one arbitrator only, unless the ICC Court of Arbitration determines that the dispute is such as to warrant three arbitrators. If the Court determines that one arbitrator is sufficient, then such arbitrator shall be a UK resident. If the Court determines that three arbitrators are necessary, then each party shall have 30 days to nominate an arbitrator of its choice - in the case of the Claimant, measured from receipt of notification of the ICC Court&#39;s decision to have three arbitrators; in the case of Respondent, measured from receipt of notification of Claimant&#39;s nomination. All nominations must be UK residents. If a party fails to nominate an arbitrator, the Court will do so. The Court shall also appoint the chairman. All arbitrators shall be and remain &quot;independent&quot; of the parties involved in the arbitration. The place of arbitration shall be England, United Kingdom. The language of the arbitration shall be English. In deciding the merits of the dispute, the tribunal shall apply the laws of England and Wales and any discovery shall be limited and shall not involve any depositions or any other examinations outside of a formal hearing. The tribunal shall not assume the powers of amiable compositeur or decide the case ex aequo et bono. In the final award, the tribunal shall fix the costs of the arbitration and decide which of the parties shall bear such costs in what proportion. Every award shall be binding on the parties. The parties undertake to carry out the award without delay and waive their right to any form of recourse against the award in so far as such waiver can validly be made. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party shall be entitled at any time to apply to the courts of England, United Kingdom for injunctive relief, or where a claim is incapable of being resolved by arbitration.

## Additional Terms for Enterprise Use

If you are a business entity, then the individual accepting on behalf of the entity (for the avoidance of doubt, for business entities, in these Terms, &quot;you&quot; means the entity) represents and warrants that he or she has the authority to act on your behalf, that you represent that you are duly authorized to do business in the country or countries where you operate, and that your employees, officers, representatives, and other agents accessing Parity Technologies&#39; Products are duly authorized to access Parity and to legally bind you to these Terms.

Subject to these Terms and subject to the Software Licence Terms, Parity Technologies grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable licence to use Parity solely on machines intended for use by your employees, officers, representatives, and agents in connection with your business entity, and provided that their use of Parity Technologies will be subject to these Terms (including the Software Licence Terms).
